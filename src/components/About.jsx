        A few things about me
      </h2>
      <p className="text-md text-justify">
        I believe that in order to build something, it can only be done when a
        solid foundation has been set. That's why I took the time to thoroughly
        study the foundation of web development, HTML and CSS. Once I felt
        comfortable with both, I went on to learn JavaScript and, following
        that, React. I can now say, that I have a solid understanding of the
        core concepts of JavaScript and React, and feel comfortable navigating
        both. This confidence also stems from the fact that I understand, very
        well, what needs to be done whenever I hit a roadblock in the
        development of projects. <br /> <br />I am a thorough and curious person
        who knows how to work through challenges. Big or small, my patient
        spirit always helps me to track down an issue and troubleshoot
        effectively. <br />
        <br />
        Part of the reason why I enjoy frontend development a lot, is my
        background in photography. I have over a decade of experience in
        photography, and the process of creating a visually appealing
        "end-product". I love the creativity in this process and see many
        similarities to frontend development, such as the composition of UI
        elements, colour schemes or the "feeling" of a design. In addition to
        that, I enjoy "building stuff", and because I am not that good with my
        hands, I realized that building digital products comes very natural to
        me.
